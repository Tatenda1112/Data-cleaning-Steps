# Data Quality Check Pipeline for Loan Data

## Overview

This module defines custom transformers for checking various data quality issues in loan datasets. It performs essential data validation tasks to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the dataset before further analysis or model building. These checks include identifying missing values, invalid dates, negative or zero amounts, duplicates, and verifying the presence of mandatory columns.

## Features

- **Missing Value Detection**: Identify missing values in important fields.
- **Invalid Date Checks**: Validate date columns to ensure correct date ranges and formats.
- **Negative or Zero Amount Validation**: Check for non-positive values in numeric columns like loan amounts or balances.
- **Duplicate Records Detection**: Ensure that there are no duplicate records in the dataset.
- **Mandatory Column Validation**: Verify the presence of key columns necessary for the analysis.
